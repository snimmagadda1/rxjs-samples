# Reactive Autocomplete Input

Implementing an input with autocomplete or type ahead functionality can be trivial with the declarative nature of RxJS.

Here I rework the ['Autocomplete' implementation](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_autocomplete.asp) from w3schools to be reactive. Doing so turned a verbose implementation into less than 30 lines of code.
