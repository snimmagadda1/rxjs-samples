# Operators

Read the output of these different operators in the console.

There are two main types of operators in RxJS: pipeable operators and creation operators. They can be used in combination to compose complex data streams in a declarative style.

Pipeable operators are used to transform and manipulate data within streams. These operators can be "piped" together using the `pipe()` method, and they include functions like `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()`.

On the other hand, creation operators are used to create new streams of data. These operators include functions like `of()` and `fromEvent()`.
