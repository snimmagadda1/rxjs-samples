This is a reference collection of examples to learn RxJS. Let's be honest, RxJS has a learning curve. When starting with RxJS, I noticed an abundance of examples specific to Angular. I found the docs very comprehensive but also overwhelming - the library is huge, and in my opinion is almost a DSL in itself.

The examples are meant to document useful patterns and demonstrate the benefits of reactive programming with RxJS, and are the output of personal use and resarch.

## Getting Started

The simplest way to run these examples is using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) as the dev server. Each example was built using the `vanilla-ts` template. To run an example, simply `cd` into the desired folder and boot up like a normal npm project:

```
git clone https://github.com/snimmagadda1/rxjs-examples.git
cd 01-rxjs-hello-world
npm install 
npm run dev
```

The example will be accessible on your local host the default port of <http://localhost:5173>.
