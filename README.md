# rxjs-examples

This is a reference collection of examples to learn RxJS. Let's be honest, RxJS has a learning curve. When starting with RxJS, I noticed an abundance of examples specific to Angular. I found the docs very comprehensive but also overwhelming - the library is huge, and in my opinion is almost a DSL in itself. These examples are meant to document useful patterns and elucidate the benefits of reactive programming with RxJS, and are the output of personal use and resarch of the libary.

## Getting Started

The simplest way to run these examples is using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) as the dev server. Each example was built using the `vanilla-ts` template. To run an example, simply `cd` into the desired folder and boot up like a normal npm project:

```
git clone https://github.com/snimmagadda1/rxjs-examples.git
cd 01-rxjs-hello-world
npm install 
npm run dev
```

The example will be accessible on your local host the default port of <http://localhost:5173>.
